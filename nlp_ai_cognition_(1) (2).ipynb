speciﬁc note that  business analysis for practitioners a practice guide  provides more indepth information about product requirements  the project’s success is directly inﬂuenced by active stakeholder involvement in the discovery and decomposition of  needs into project and product requirements and by the care taken in determining documenting and managing the  requirements of the product service or result of the project requirements include conditions or capabilities that are  required to be present in a product service or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed speciﬁcation  requirements include the quantiﬁed and documented needs and expectations of the sponsor customer and other  stakeholders these requirements need to be elicited analyzed and recorded in enough detail to be included in the  scope baseline and to be measured once project execution begins requirements become the foundation of the wbs  cost schedule quality planning and procurement are all based on these requirements.   the project charter documents the highlevel project description and highlevel  requirements that will be used to develop detailed requirements.   project management plan

the requirements management plan has  information on how project requirements will be collected analyzed and documented  stakeholder engagement plan   the stakeholder engagement plan is used  to understand stakeholder communication requirements and the level of stakeholder engagement in order to  assess and adapt to the level of stakeholder participation in requirements activities. examples of project documents that can be considered.   a business document that can inﬂuence the collect requirements process is the  business case which can describe required desired and optional criteria for meeting the business needs.   agreements can contain project and product requirements. the enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the collect requirements process include but are not limited to  organization’s culture  infrastructure  personnel administration and  marketplace conditions. the organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the collect requirements process include but are not limited to  policies and procedures and  historical information and lessons learned repository with information from previous projects.   expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics  business analysis  requirements elicitation  requirements analysis  requirements documentation  project requirements in previous similar projects  diagramming techniques  facilitation and  conﬂict management. datagathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to  brainstorming   brainstorming is a technique used to generate and collect multiple  ideas related to project and product requirements  interviews an interview is a formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders by talking  to them directly it is typically performed by asking prepared and spontaneous questions and recording the  responses interviews are often conducted on an individual basis between an interviewer and an interviewee but  may involve multiple interviewers andor multiple interviewees interviewing experienced project participants  sponsors other executives and subject matter experts can aid in identifying and deﬁning the features and  functions of the desired product deliverables interviews are also useful for obtaining conﬁdential information  focus groups focus groups bring together prequaliﬁed stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about  their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product service or result a trained moderator guides the  group through an interactive discussion designed to be more conversational than a oneonone interview    questionnaires and surveys questionnaires and surveys are written sets of questions designed to quickly  accumulate information from a large number of respondents questionnaires andor surveys are most appropriate  with varied audiences when a quick turnaround is needed when respondents are geographically dispersed and  where statistical analysis could be appropriate  benchmarking   benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned products  processes and practices to those of comparable organizations to identify best practices generate ideas for  improvement and provide a basis for measuring performance the organizations compared during benchmarking  can be internal or external.   data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited  to document analysis document analysis consists of reviewing and assessing any relevant documented information  in this process document analysis is used to elicit requirements by analyzing existing documentation and identifying  information relevant to the requirements there is a wide range of documents that may be analyzed to help elicit relevant  requirements examples of documents that may be analyzed include but are not limited to  agreements  business plans  business process or interface documentation  business rules repositories  current process ﬂows  marketing literature  problemissue logs  policies and procedures  regulatory documentation such as laws codes or ordinances etc  requests for proposal and  use cases. decisionmaking techniques that can be used in the collect requirements process include but are not limited to  voting voting is a collective decisionmaking technique and an assessment process having multiple alternatives  with an expected outcome in the form of future actions these techniques can be used to generate classify and  prioritize product requirements examples of voting techniques include  unanimity a decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of action  majority a decision that is reached with support obtained from more than  of the members of the group  having a group size with an uneven number of participants can ensure that a decision will be reached rather  than resulting in a tie  plurality a decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides even if a majority is not  achieved this method is generally used when the number of options nominated is more than two   autocratic decision making in this method one individual takes responsibility for making the decision  for the group  multicriteria decision analysis a technique that uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical  approach for establishing criteria such as risk levels uncertainty and valuation to evaluate and rank many ideas. data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to  affinity diagrams afﬁnity diagrams allow large numbers of ideas to be classiﬁed into groups for review and  analysis  mind mapping mind mapping consolidates ideas created through individual brainstorming sessions into a  single map to reﬂect commonality and differences in understanding and to generate new ideas.   the interpersonal and team skills that can be used in this process include but are not  limited to  nominal group technique the nominal group technique enhances brainstorming with a voting process used  to rank the most useful ideas for further brainstorming or for prioritization the nominal group technique is a  structured form of brainstorming consisting of four steps    a question or problem is posed to the group each person silently generates and writes down their ideas  the moderator writes down the ideas on a ﬂip chart until all ideas are recorded  each recorded idea is discussed until all group members have a clear understanding  individuals vote privately to prioritize the ideas usually using a scale of   with  being the lowest and   being the highest voting may take place in many rounds to reduce and focus in on ideas after each round  the votes are tallied and the highest scoring ideas are selected  observationconversation observation and conversation provide a direct way of viewing individuals in their  environment and how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out processes it is particularly helpful for detailed  processes when the people who use the product have difﬁculty or are reluctant to articulate their requirements  observation is also known as “job shadowing” it is usually done externally by an observer viewing a business  expert performing a job it can also be done by a “participant observer” who actually performs a process or  procedure to experience how it is done to uncover hidden requirements  facilitation   facilitation is used with focused sessions that bring key stakeholders  together to deﬁne product requirements workshops can be used to quickly deﬁne crossfunctional  requirements and reconcile stakeholder differences because of their interactive group nature wellfacilitated  sessions can build trust foster relationships and improve communication among the participants which can  lead to increased stakeholder consensus in addition issues can be discovered earlier and resolved more  quickly than in individual sessions facilitation skills are used in the following situations but are not limited to  joint application designdevelopment jad jad sessions are used in the software development industry  these facilitated sessions focus on bringing business subject matter experts and the development team  together to gather requirements and improve the software development process  quality function deployment qfd in the manufacturing industry qfd is another facilitation technique that  helps determine critical characteristics for new product development qfd starts by collecting customer  needs also known as voice of the customer voc these needs are then objectively sorted and prioritized  and goals are set for achieving them  user stories user stories which are short textual descriptions of required functionality are often developed  during a requirements workshop user stories describe the stakeholder role who beneﬁts fr. the context diagram is an example of a scope model context diagrams visually depict the product scope by showing  a business system process equipment computer system etc and how people and other systems actors interact  with it see figure  context diagrams. prototyping is a method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a model of the expected product  before actually building it examples of prototypes are smallscale products computer generated d and d models  mockups or simulations prototypes allow stakeholders to experiment with a model of the ﬁnal product rather than  being limited to discussing abstract representations of their requirements prototypes support the concept of progressive  elaboration in iterative cycles of mockup creation user experimentation feedback generation and prototype revision  when enough feedback cycles have been performed the requirements obtained from the prototype are sufﬁciently  complete to move to a design or build phase storyboarding is a prototyping technique showing sequence or navigation through a series of images or illustrations  storyboards are used on a variety of projects in a variety of industries such as ﬁlm advertising instructional design  and on agile and other software development projects in software development storyboards use mockups to show  navigation paths through web pages screens or other user interfaces. requirements documentation describes how individual requirements meet the business need for the project  requirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more information about the  requirements is known before being baselined requirements need to be unambiguous measurable and testable  traceable complete consistent and acceptable to key stakeholders the format of the requirements document may  range from a simple document listing all the requirements categorized by stakeholder and priority to more elaborate  forms containing an executive summary detailed descriptions and attachments     many organizations categorize requirements into different types such as business and technical solutions the  former referring to stakeholder needs and the latter as to how those needs will be implemented requirements can  be grouped into classiﬁcations allowing for further reﬁnement and detail as the requirements are elaborated these  classiﬁcations include  business requirements these describe the higherlevel needs of the organization as a whole such as the  business issues or opportunities and reasons why a project has been undertaken  stakeholder requirements these describe needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group  solution requirements these describe features functions and characteristics of the product service or  result that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements solution requirements are further grouped into  functional and nonfunctional requirements  functional requirements functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product examples include  actions processes data and interactions that the product should execute  nonfunctional requirements nonfunctional requirements supplement functional requirements and describe  the environmental conditions or qualities required for the product to be effective examples include reliability  security performance safety level of service supportability retentionpurge etc  transition and readiness requirements these describe temporary capabilities such as data conversion and  training requirements needed to transition from the current asis state to the desired future state  project requirements these describe the actions processes or other conditions the project needs to meet  examples include milestone dates contractual obligations constraints etc  quality requirements these capture any condition or criteria needed to validate the successful completion  of a project deliverable or fulﬁllment of other project requirements examples include tests certiﬁcations  validations etc. the requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables  that satisfy them the implementation of a requirements traceability matrix helps ensure that each requirement adds  business value by linking it to the business and project objectives it provides a means to track requirements throughout  the project life cycle helping to ensure that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at  the end of the project finally it provides a structure for managing changes to the product scope   tracing requirements includes but is not limited to  business needs opportunities goals and objectives  project objectives  project scope and wbs deliverables  product design  product development  test strategy and test scenarios and  highlevel requirements to more detailed requirements attributes associated with each requirement can be recorded in the requirements traceability matrix these  attributes help to deﬁne key information about the requirement typical attributes used in the requirements traceability  matrix may include a unique identiﬁer a textual description of the requirement the rationale for inclusion owner  source priority version current status such as active cancelled deferred added approved assigned completed  and status date additional attributes to ensure that the requirement has met stakeholders’ satisfaction may include  stability complexity and acceptance criteria figure  provides an example of a requirements traceability matrix  with its associated attributes figure  example of a requirements traceability matrix requirements traceability matrix requirements description id business needs opportunities goals objectives project

learned from previous phases or projects.   expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with knowledge of or  experience with similar projects. an example of a data analysis technique that can be used in this process includes but is not limited to alternatives  analysis alternatives analysis can be used to evaluate ways to meet the requirements and the objectives identiﬁed in  the charter.   a decisionmaking technique that can be used in this process includes but is not limited  to multicriteria decision analysis   multicriteria decision analysis is a technique that uses  a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical approach for establishing criteria such as requirements schedule  budget and resources in order to reﬁne the project and product scope for the project.   an example of an interpersonal and team skills technique is facilitation facilitation  is used in workshops and working sessions with key stakeholders who have a variety of expectations or ﬁelds of  expertise the goal is to reach a crossfunctional and common understanding of the project deliverables and project  and product boundaries. product analysis can be used to deﬁne products and services it includes asking questions about a product or service  and forming answers to describe the use characteristics and other relevant aspects of what is going to be delivered each application area has one or more generally accepted methods for translating highlevel product or service  descriptions into meaningful deliverables requirements are captured at a high level and decomposed to the level of  detail needed to design the ﬁnal product examples of product analysis techniques include but are not limited to  product breakdown  requirements analysis  systems analysis  systems engineering  value analysis and  value engineering. the project scope statement is the description of the project scope major deliverables assumptions and constraints  the project scope statement documents the entire scope including project and product scope it describes the project’s  deliverables in detail it also provides a common understanding of the project scope among project stakeholders it may  contain explicit scope exclusions that can assist in managing stakeholder expectations it enables the project team  to perform more detailed planning guides the project team’s work during execution and provides the baseline for  evaluating whether requests for changes or additional work are contained within or outside the project’s boundaries the degree and level of detail to which the project scope statement deﬁnes the work that will be performed and the  work that is excluded can help determine how well the project management team can control the overall project scope  the detailed project scope statement either directly or by reference to other documents includes the following  product scope description progressively elaborates the characteristics of the product service or result  described in the project charter and requirements documentation  deliverables any unique and verifiable product result or capability to perform a service that is required  to be produced to complete a process phase or project deliverables also include ancillary results such as  project management reports and documentation these deliverables may be described at a summary level  or in great detail  acceptance criteria a set of conditions that is required to be met before deliverables are accepted  project exclusions identiﬁes what is excluded from the project explicitly stating what is out of scope for the  project helps manage stakeholders’ expectations and can reduce scope creep although the project charter and the project scope statement are sometimes perceived as containing a certain  degree of redundancy they are different in the level of detail contained in each the project charter contains high level information while the project scope statement contains a

subdividing project deliverables and project work into smaller more manageable  components the key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides a framework of what has to be delivered this process is  performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project  the wbs is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish  the project objectives and create the required deliverables the wbs organizes and deﬁnes the total scope of the project  and represents the work speciﬁed in the current approved project scope statement the planned work is contained within the lowest level of wbs components which are called work packages a work  package can be used to group the activities where work is scheduled and estimated monitored and controlled in the  context of the wbs work refers to work products or deliverables that are the result of activity and not to the activity itself. a project management plan component includes but is not limited to the scope management plan described in  section  the scope management plan documents how the wbs will be created from the project scope statement. examples of project documents that can be considered. the enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the create wbs process include but are not limited to  industryspeciﬁc wbs standards that are relevant to the nature of the project these industryspeciﬁc standards may  serve as external reference sources for creating the wbs. the organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the create wbs process include but are not limited to  policies procedures and templates for the wbs  project ﬁles from previous projects and  lessons learned from previous projects.   expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with knowledge of or  experience with similar projects. decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project deliverables into  smaller more manageable parts the work package is the work deﬁned at the lowest level of the wbs for which cost and  duration can be estimated and managed the level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed to  effectively manage the project the level of detail for work packages will vary with the size and complexity of the project  decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally involves the following activities  identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work  structuring and organizing the wbs  decomposing the upper wbs levels into lowerlevel detailed components  developing and assigning identiﬁcation codes to the wbs components and  verifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate a portion of a wbs with some branches of the wbs decomposed down through the work package level is shown in  figure  figure  sample wbs decomposed down through work packages  value management system project  needs assessment  standards development

a wbs on this type of project  components identification  gap assessment  alternatives identification  system requirements development  alternatives development  requirements determination  current system audit  components analysis  requirements changes identification  alternatives analysis   a wbs structure may be created through various approaches some of the popular methods include the topdown  approach the use of organizationspeciﬁc guidelines and the use of wbs templates a bottomup approach can be used  to group subcomponents the wbs structure can be represented in a number of forms such as  using phases of the project life cycle as the second level of decomposition with the product and project  deliverables inserted at the third level as shown in figure   using major deliverables as the second level of decomposition as shown in figure  and  incorporating subcomponents that may be developed by organizations outside the project team such as  contracted work the

can  be changed only through formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison it is a component of  the project management plan components of the scope baseline include  project scope statement the project scope statement includes the description of the project scope major  deliverables assumptions and constraints section   wbs the wbs is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team  to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables each descending level of the wbs  represents an increasingly detailed deﬁnition of the project work  work package the lowest level of the wbs is a work package with a unique identiﬁer these identiﬁers provide  a structure for hierarchical summation of costs schedule and resource information and form a code of accounts  each work package is part of a control account a control account is a management control point where scope  budget and schedule are integrated and compared to the earned value for performance measurement a control  account has two or more work packages though each work package is associated with a single control account  planning package a control account may include one or more planning packages a planning package is a  work breakdown structure component below the control account and above the work package with known work  content but without detailed schedule activities      wbs dictionary the wbs dictionary is a document that provides detailed deliverable activity and scheduling  information about each component in the wbs the wbs dictionary is a document that supports the wbs most  of the information included in the wbs dictionary is created by other processes and added to this document at a  later stage information in the wbs dictionary may include but is not limited to  code of account identiﬁer  description of work  assumptions and constraints  responsible organization  schedule milestones  associated schedule activities  resources required  cost estimates  quality requirements  acceptance criteria  technical references and  agreement information. project documents that may be updated as

measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change corrective action or  preventive action is necessary. project documents that can be considered. work performance data can include the number of change requests received the number of requests accepted and  the number of deliverables veriﬁed validated and completed. the organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the control scope process include but are not limited to  existing formal and informal scope controlrelated policies procedures guidelines and  monitoring and reporting methods and templates to be used. data analysis techniques that can be used in the control scope process include but are not limited to  variance analysis   variance analysis is used to compare the baseline to the actual  results and determine if the variance is within the threshold amount or if corrective or preventive action is  appropriate  trend analysis   trend analysis examines project performance over time to  determine if performance is improving or deteriorating important aspects of project scope control include determining the cause and degree of variance relative to the scope  baseline section  and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. work performance information produced includes correlated and contextualized information on how the project  and product scope are performing compared to the scope baseline it can include the categories of the changes  received the identiﬁed scope variances and their causes how they impact schedule or cost and the forecast of the  future scope performance.   analysis of project performance may result in a change request to the scope and  schedule baselines or other components of the project management plan change requests are processed for review  and disposition through the perform integrated change control process section. any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change  request components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to  scope management plan   the scope management plan may be updated to reﬂect  a change in how the scope is managed  scope baseline   changes to the scope baseline are incorporated in response to  approved changes in scope scope statement the wbs or the wbs dictionary in some cases scope variances can  be so severe that a revised scope baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement  schedule baseline   changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated in response  to approved changes in scope resources or schedule estimates in some cases schedule variances can be so  severe that a revised schedule baseline is needed to provide a

a data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis  alternatives analysis can include determining which schedule methodology to use or how to combine various  methods on the project it can also include determining how detailed the schedule needs to be the duration of  waves for rolling wave planning and how often it should be reviewed and updated an appropriate balance between  the level of detail needed to manage the schedule and the amount of time it takes to keep it up to date needs to be  reached for each project. project teams may hold planning meetings to develop the schedule management plan participants at these meetings  may include the project manager the project sponsor selected project team members selected stakeholders anyone  with responsibility for schedule planning or execution and others as needed. the schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteria  and the activities for developing monitoring and controlling the schedule the schedule management plan may be  formal or informal highly detailed or broadly framed based on the needs of the project and includes appropriate  control thresholds     the schedule management plan can establish the following  project schedule model development the scheduling methodology and the scheduling tool

and informal activity planningrelated policies procedures and guidelines such as the scheduling  methodology that are considered in developing the activity deﬁnitions.   expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  of similar past projects and the work being performed.   decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and  project deliverables into smaller more manageable parts activities represent the effort needed to complete a work  package the deﬁne activities process deﬁnes the ﬁnal outputs as activities rather than deliverables as done in the  create wbs process section  the activity list wbs and wbs dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently with the wbs and wbs  dictionary used as the basis for development of the ﬁnal activity list each work package within the wbs is decomposed  into the activities required to produce the work package deliverables involving team members in the decomposition can  lead to better and more accurate results. rolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is  planned in detail while work further in the future is planned at a higher level it is a form of progressive elaboration  applicable to work packages planning packages and release planning when using an agile or waterfall approach  therefore work can exist at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the project life cycle during early  strategic planning when information is less deﬁned work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail as  more is known about the upcoming events in the near term work packages can be decomposed into activities. meetings may be facetoface virtual formal or informal meetings may be held with team members or subject  matter experts to deﬁne the activities needed to complete the work. the activity list includes the schedule activities required on the project for projects that use rolling wave planning  or agile techniques the activity list will be updated periodically as the project progresses the activity list includes  an activity identiﬁer and a scope of work description for each activity in sufﬁcient detail to ensure that project team  members understand what work is required to be completed. activity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with each  activity the components for each activity evolve over time during the initial stages of the project they include  the unique activity identiﬁer id wbs id and activity label or name when completed they may include activity  descriptions predecessor activities successor activities logical relationships leads and lags section   resource requirements imposed dates constraints and assumptions activity attributes can be used to identify the  place where the work has to be performed the project calendar the activity is assigned to and the type of effort  involved activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting ordering and sorting the planned  schedule activities in various ways within reports. a milestone is a signiﬁcant point or event in a project a milestone list identiﬁes all project milestones and indicates  whether the milestone is mandatory such as those required by contract or optional such as those based on historical  information milestones have zero duration because they represent a signiﬁcant point or event.   once the project has been baselined the progressive elaboration of deliverables into  activities may reveal work that was not initially part of the project baselines this may result in a change request  change requests are processed for review and disposition through the perform integrated change control process  section. any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change  request components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to  schedule baseline   throughout the project work packages are progressively  elaborated into activities this

cost baseline   changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to  approved changes in schedule activities    sequence activities sequence activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities the key  beneﬁt of this process is that it deﬁnes the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efﬁciency given all project  constraints this process is performed throughout the project   every activity except the ﬁrst and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successor  activity with an appropriate logical relationship logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic project  schedule it may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable project  schedule sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automated  techniques the sequence activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram to  act as a ﬁrst step to publish the schedule baseline.   project management plan components include but are not limited to  schedule management plan   the

systems. the organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the sequence activities process include but are not limited to  portfolio and program plans and project dependencies and relationships  existing formal and informal activity planningrelated policies procedures and guidelines such as the scheduling  methodology that is considered in developing logical relationships  templates that can be used to expedite the preparation of networks for project activities related activity attributes  information in templates can also contain additional descriptive information useful in sequencing activities and  lessons learned repository containing historical information that can help optimize the sequencing process. the precedence diagramming method pdm is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities  are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which  the activities are to be performed pdm includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships a predecessor activity is an activity that logically  comes before a dependent activity in a schedule a successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after  another activity in a schedule these relationships are deﬁned below and are illustrated in figure       finishtostart fs a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity  has ﬁnished for example installing the operating system on a pc successor cannot start until the pc hardware  is assembled predecessor  finishtofinish ff a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity  has ﬁnished for example writing a document predecessor is required to ﬁnish before editing the document  successor can ﬁnish  starttostart ss a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity  has started for example level concrete successor cannot begin until pour foundation predecessor begins  starttofinish sf a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity  has started for example a new accounts payable system successor has to start before the old accounts  payable system can be shut down predecessor in pdm fs is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship the sf relationship is very rarely used but  is included to present a complete list of the pdm relationship types two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time for example ss and ff multiple relationships  between the same activities are not recommended so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the  highest impact closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships figure  precedence diagramming method pdm relationship types activity a activity b activity a activity a activity b activity b activity a activity b finish to start fs start to finish sf start to start ss finish to finish ff. dependencies may be characterized by the following attributes mandatory or discretionary internal or external  as described below dependency has four attributes but two can be applicable at the same time in the following  ways mandatory external dependencies mandatory internal dependencies discretionary external dependencies or  discretionary internal dependencies  mandatory dependencies mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or  inherent in the nature of the work mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations such as on a  construction project where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built  or on an electronics project where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested mandatory dependencies  are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies technical dependencies may not be mandatory  the project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities  mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool  discretionary dependencies discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic  preferential logic or soft logic discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best  practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a speciﬁc sequence  is desired even though there may be other acceptable sequences for example generally accepted best  practices recommend that during construction the electrical work should start after ﬁnishing the plumbing  work this order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time in parallel but performing  the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk discretionary dependencies should be fully  documented since they can create arbitrary total ﬂoat values and can limit later scheduling options when fast  tracking techniques are employed these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for  modiﬁcation or removal the project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the process  of sequencing the activities      external dependencies external dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non project activities these dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control for example the  testing activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source or  governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction  project the project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of  sequencing the activities  internal dependencies internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and  are generally inside the project team’s control for example if the team cannot test a machine until they as. a lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity for example  on a project to construct a new ofﬁce building the landscaping could be scheduled to start  weeks prior to the scheduled  punch list completion this would be shown as a ﬁnishtostart with a week lead as shown in figure  lead is often  represented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software figure  examples of lead and lag complete punch list write draft landscape building lot edit draft ss  days lag fs  weeks lead   a lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity for example  a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document  days after they begin writing it this can be  shown as a starttostart relationship with a day lag as shown in figure  lag can also be represented in project  schedule network diagrams as shown in figure  in the relationship between activities h and i as indicated by the  nomenclature ss starttostart plus  days lag even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale the project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately deﬁne the  logical relationship the use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic also duration estimates do not include  any leads or lags activities and their related assumptions should be documented figure  project schedule network diagram.   project management information systems includes scheduling software that has the  capability to help plan organize and adjust the sequence of the activities insert the logical relationships lead and lag  values and differentiate the different types of dependencies a b c d e begin h f g end i j k l ff fs   ss   ss. a project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships also referred to as  dependencies among the project schedule activities figure  illustrates a project schedule network diagram a  project schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software it can include full  project details or have one or more summary activities a summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describe  the basic approach used to sequence the activities any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fully  described within the narrative activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence activities that have multiple successor  activities indicate a path divergence activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affected  by multiple activities or can affect multiple activities activity i is called a path convergence as it has more than one  predecessor while activity k is called a path divergence as it has more than one successor. project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to  activity attributes   activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of  events or deﬁned predecessor or successor relationships as well as deﬁned lead and lag and logical relationships  between the activities  activity list   the activity list may be impacted by the change in relationships  among the project activities during the sequencing activities  assumption log   assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may  need to be updated based on the sequencing relationship determination and leads and lags and may give rise  to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule  milestone list   the scheduled dates for speciﬁc milestones may be impacted by  changes in relationships among the project activities during the sequencing activities    estimate activity durations estimate activity durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual  activities with estimated resources the key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity  will take to complete this process is performed throughout the project   number of resources as well as the schedule network analysis technique used  the estimate activity durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete  the activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity these estimates are used to  approximate the number of work periods activity duration needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project  and resource calendars in many cases the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an  activity along with the skill proﬁciency of those resources may determine the activity’s duration a change to a driving  resource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration but this is not a simple “straightline” or  linear relationship sometimes the intrinsic nature of the work ie constraints imposed on the duration effort involved  or number of resources will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation  eg a hour stress test other factors for consideration when estimating duration include  law of diminishing returns when one factor eg resource used to determine the effort required to produce a  unit of work is increased while all other factors remain ﬁxed a point will eventually be reached at which additions  of that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output  number of resources increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does  not always reduce the time by half as it may increase extra duration due to risk and at some point adding  too many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer learning curve additional  coordination and ot.   project management plan components include but are not limited to  schedule management plan   the schedule management plan deﬁnes the method  used as well as the level of accuracy and other criteria required to estimate activity durations  scope baseline   the scope baseline includes the wbs dictionary which contains  technical details that can inﬂuence the effort and duration estimates. project documents that can be considered   resource calendars   the resource calendars inﬂuence the duration of schedule  activities due to the availability of speciﬁc resources type of resources and resources with speciﬁc attributes  resource calendars specify when and how long identiﬁed project resources will be available during the project  resource requirements   the estimated activity resource requirements will have  an effect on the duration of the activity since the level to which the resources assigned to the activity meet  the requirements will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the duration of most activities for example if additional or lower skilled resources are assigned to an activity there may be reduced efﬁciency or productivity due to increased  communication training and coordination needs leading to a longer duration estimate  risk register   individual project risks may impact resource selection and  availability updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates    from plan risk responses. the enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the estimate activity durations process include but are not  limited to  duration estimating databases and other reference data  productivity metrics  published commercial information and  location of team members. the organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the estimate activity durations process include but are not  limited to  historical duration information  project calendars  estimating policies  scheduling methodology and  lessons learned repository   durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor  hours per unit of work for example duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by  the number of labor hours per drawing or on a cable installation the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor  hours per meter if the assigned resource is capable of installing  meters of cable per hour the duration required to  install  meters is  hours  meters divided by  meters per hour this technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into  the model parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project in conjunction  with other estimating methods. the accuracy of singlepoint duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk  using threepoint estimates helps deﬁne an approximate range for an activity’s duration  most likely tm this estimate is based on the duration of the activity given the resources likely to be assigned  their productivity realistic expectations of availability for the activity dependencies on other participants and  interruptions  optimistic to the activity duration based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity  pessimistic tp the duration based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates the expected duration te  can be calculated one commonly used formula is triangular distribution te  to  tm  tp   triangular distribution is used when there is insufﬁcient historical data or when using judgmental data duration  estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of  uncertainty around the expected duration. bottomup estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower level components of the wbs when an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of conﬁdence  the work within the activity is decomposed into more detail the detail durations are estimated these estimates are  then aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations activities may or may not have dependencies  between them that can affect the application and use of resources if there are dependencies this pattern of resource  usage is reﬂected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity. data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to  alternatives analysis alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills  scheduling compression techniques   different tools manual versus automated  and make rent or buy decisions regarding the resources this allows the team to weigh resource cost and  duration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work  reserve analysis reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserve  needed for the project duration estimates may include contingency reserves sometimes referred to as schedule  reserves to account for schedule uncertainty contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedule  baseline which is allocated for identiﬁed risks that are accepted contingency reserves are associated with the  knownunknowns which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework the contingency  reserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a ﬁxed number of work periods contingency  reserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated as more precise information about the  project becomes available the contingency reserve may be used reduced or eliminated contingency should be  clearly identiﬁed in the schedule documentation estimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project management  reserves are a speciﬁed amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are  reserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project management reserves are intended to address  the unknownunknowns that can affect a project management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline  but it is part of the overall project duration requirements depending on contract terms use of management  reserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.   decisionmaking techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limited  to voting one variation of the voting method that is often used in agilebased projects is called the ﬁst of ﬁve also called  ﬁst to ﬁve in this technique the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding  up a closed ﬁst indicating no support up to ﬁve ﬁngers indicating full support if a team member holds up fewer than  three ﬁngers the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team the project manager  continues the ﬁstofﬁve process until the team achieves consensus everyone holds up three or more ﬁngers or agrees  to move on to the next decision. the project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations when using an agile approach it is necessary  to conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items user stories and decide  which of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration the team breaks down user stories to  lowlevel tasks with estimates in hours and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacity  over the duration iteration this meeting is usually held on the ﬁrst day of the iteration and is attended by the product  owner the scrum team and the project manager the outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog as well as  assumptions concerns risks dependencies decisions and actions. duration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to complete  an activity a phase or a project duration estimates do not include any lags as   duration  estimates may include some indication of the range of possible results for example  a range of  weeks ±  days which indicates that the activity will take at least  days and not more than   assuming a day work week or  a  probability of exceeding  weeks which indicates a high probability  that the activity will take   weeks or less. the amount and type of additional details supporting the duration estimate vary by application area regardless of  the level of detail the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration  estimate was derived supporting detail for duration estimates may include  documentation of the basis of the estimate ie how it was developed  documentation of all assumptions made  documentation of any known constraints  indication of the range of possible estimates eg ± to indicate that the duration is estimated between a  range of values  indication of the conﬁdence level of the ﬁnal estimate and  documentation of individual project risks inﬂuencing this estimate. project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to  activity attributes   activity duration estimates produced during this process are  documented as part of the activity attributes  assumption log   this includes assumptions made in developing the duration  estimate such as resource skill levels and availability as well as a basis of estimates for durations additionally  constraints arising out of the scheduling methodology and scheduling tool are also documented  lessons learned register   the lessons learned register can be updated with  techniques that were efﬁcient and effective in developing effort and duration estimates    develop schedule develop schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences durations resource requirements and schedule  constraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling the key beneﬁt of this  process is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities this process  is performed throughout the project   figure  develop schedule data flow diagram developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process the schedule model is used to determine the  planned start and ﬁnish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information schedule  development can require the review and revision of duration estimates resource estimates and schedule reserves to  establish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress key steps include deﬁning the  project milestones identifying and sequencing activities and estimating durations once the activity start and ﬁnish  dates have been determined it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned  activities the staff conﬁrms that the start and ﬁnish dates present no conﬂict with resource calendars or assigned  activities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid the schedule is then analyzed to determine conﬂicts with  logical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined revising and  maintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project  as   for more speciﬁc information regarding scheduling refer to the practice standard for scheduling.   project management plan components include but are not

vendors may have an input to the project schedule as they develop the details of how  they will perform the project work to meet contractual commitments. the enterprise environmental factors that can inﬂuence the develop schedule process include but are not limited to  government or industry standards and  communication channels. the organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the develop schedule process include but are not limited to  scheduling methodology containing the policies governing schedule model development and maintenance  and  project calendars. schedule network analysis is the overarching technique used to generate the project schedule model it employs  several other techniques such as critical path method   resource optimization techniques    and modeling techniques   additional analysis includes but  is not limited to  assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiple  paths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time to reduce the  probability of a schedule slip  reviewing the network to see if the critical path has highrisk activities or long lead items that would necessitate  use of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed. the critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule  ﬂexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model this schedule network analysis technique calculates  the early start early ﬁnish late start and late ﬁnish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations  by performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network as shown in figure  in this  example the longest path includes activities a c and d and therefore the sequence of acd is the critical path  the critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project which determines  the shortest possible project duration the longest path has the least total ﬂoat usually zero the resulting early  and late start and ﬁnish dates are not necessarily the project schedule rather they indicate the time periods within  which the activity could be executed using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations logical  relationships leads lags and other known constraints the critical path method is used to calculate the critical paths  and the amount of total and free ﬂoat or schedule ﬂexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model on any network path the total ﬂoat or schedule ﬂexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule  activity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project ﬁnish date or violating a  schedule constraint a critical path is normally characterized by zero total ﬂoat on the critical path as implemented  with the precedence diagramming method sequencing critical paths may have positive zero or negative total ﬂoat  depending on the constraints applied positive total ﬂoat is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a  schedule constraint that is later than the early ﬁnish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation  negative total ﬂoat is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic negative ﬂoat  analysis is a technique that helps to ﬁnd possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track  schedule networks may have multiple nearcritical paths many software packages allow the user to deﬁne the  parameters used to determine the critical paths adjustments to activity durations when more resources or less  scope can be arranged logical relationships when the relationships were discretionary to begin with leads and  lags or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total ﬂoat  once the total ﬂoat and the free ﬂoat have been calculated the free ﬂoat is the amount of time that a schedule  activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint for  example the free ﬂoat for activity b in figure  is  days   critical path link noncritical path link activity node start finish a   . resource optimization is used to adjust the start and ﬁnish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be  equal to or less than resource availability examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the  schedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to  resource leveling a technique in which start and ﬁnish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with  the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply resource leveling can be used when  shared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities or are over allocated such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period as  shown in figure  or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level resource leveling can often  cause the original critical path to change available ﬂoat is used for leveling resources consequently the critical  path through the project schedule may change  resource smoothing a technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for  resources on the project do not exceed certain predeﬁned resource limits in resource smoothing as opposed to  resource leveling the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed in other  words activities may only be delayed within their free and total ﬂoat resource smoothing may not be able to  optimize all resources     figure  resource leveling start activity a tom  hrs sue  hrs activity b sue  hrs activity c tom  hrs tom  hrs sue  hrs tom  hrs day  day  day  start activity a tom  hrs sue  hrs activity

objectives this is an analysis of the question “what if the situation  represented by scenario happens” a schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to compute  the different scenarios such as delaying a major component delivery extending speciﬁc engineering durations  or introducing external factors such as a strike or a change in the permit process the outcome of the whatif  scenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions and in  preparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations  simulation simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty  to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives the most common simulation technique is  monte carlo analysis see section  in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate  possible schedule outcomes for the total project simulation involves calculating multiple work package durations  with different sets of activity assumptions constraints risks issues or scenarios using probability distributions  and other representations of uncertainty see section  figure  shows a probability distribution for a  project with the probability of achieving a certain target date ie project ﬁnish date in this example there is a   probability that the project will ﬁnish on or before the target date of may  while there is a  probability  of completing the project by may      project finish date                                        figure

reﬁnements applied during network analysis to develop a viable  schedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities leads are used in limited circumstances to advance a  successor activity with respect to the predecessor activity and lags are used in limited circumstances where processes  require a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact. schedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing the  project scope in order to meet schedule constraints imposed dates or other schedule objectives a helpful technique  is the negative ﬂoat analysis the critical path is the one with the least ﬂoat due to violating a constraint or imposed  date the total ﬂoat can become negative schedule compression techniques are compared in figure  and include  crashing a technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources  examples of crashing include approving overtime bringing in additional resources or paying to expedite delivery  to activities on the critical path crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources  will shorten the activity’s duration crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in  increased risk andor cost  fast tracking a schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence  are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration an example is constructing the foundation for a  building before completing all of the architectural drawings fast tracking may result in rework and increased  risk fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical  path using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities  concerned and increases quality risk fast tracking may also increase project costs figure  schedule compression comparison normal crashing fast tracking                                          high risk high cost.   project management information systems include scheduling software that expedites  the process of building a schedule model by generating start and ﬁnish dates based on. agile release planning provides a highlevel summary timeline of the release schedule typically  to  months  based on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product’s evolution agile release planning also  determines the number of iterations or sprints in the release and allows the product owner and team to decide  how much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals  dependencies and impediments since features represent value to the customer the timeline provides a more easily understood project schedule  as it deﬁnes which feature will be available at the end of each iteration which is

comparison to actual results it is accepted and approved by the appropriate  stakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline ﬁnish dates during monitoring and  controlling the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and ﬁnish dates to determine if variances have  occurred the schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan. the project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates durations  milestones and resources at a minimum the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned ﬁnish date  for each activity if resource planning is done at an early stage the project schedule remains preliminary until resource  assignments have been conﬁrmed and scheduled start and ﬁnish dates are established this process usually occurs no  later than the completion of the project management plan section  a target project schedule model may also  be developed with a deﬁned target start and target ﬁnish for each activity the project schedule may be presented in  summary form sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule or presented in detail although  a project schedule model can be presented in tabular form it is more often presented graphically using one or more of  the following formats  bar charts also known as gantt charts bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listed  on the vertical axis dates are shown on the horizontal axis and activity durations are shown as horizontal  bars placed according to start and ﬁnish dates bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used  depending on the audience ﬂoat can be depicted or not for control and management communications the  broader more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent  work packages and is displayed in bar chart reports an example is the summary schedule portion of figure   that is presented in a wbsstructured format      milestone charts these charts are similar to bar charts but only identify the scheduled start or completion of  major deliverables and key external interfaces an example is the milestone schedule portion of figure   project schedule network diagrams these diagrams are commonly presented in the activityonnode  diagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale sometimes referred to as a pure  logic diagram as shown in figure  or presented in a timescaled schedule network diagram format that  is sometimes called a logic bar chart as shown for the detailed schedule in figure  these diagrams with  activity date information usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path schedule  activities this example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities  another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a timescaled logic diagram these diagrams  include a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships they are  optimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on the  same line of the diagram in sequence  figure  shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed with the work in progress reported  through asof date or status date for a simple project s. the schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information for describing and controlling the  schedule the schedule data includes at a minimum the schedule milestones schedule activities activity attributes  and documentation of all identiﬁed assumptions and constraints the amount of additional data varies by application  area information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to  resource requirements by time period often in the form of a resource histogram  alternative schedules such as bestcase or worstcase not resourceleveled or resourceleveled or with or  without imposed dates and  applied schedule reserves schedule data could also include such items as resource histograms cashﬂow projections order and delivery  schedules or other relevant information. a project calendar identiﬁes working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities it distinguishes  time periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are not  available for work a schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods for  some activities to calculate the project schedule the project calendars may be updated.   modiﬁcations to the project scope or project schedule may result in change requests  to the scope baseline andor other components of the project management plan change requests are processed for  review and disposition through the perform integrated change control process section  preventive actions may  include recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances. any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change  request components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to  schedule management plan   the schedule management plan may be updated to  reﬂect a change in the way the schedule was developed and will be managed  cost baseline   changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to  approved changes in scope

revisions generated by the develop schedule process  assumption log   the assumption log may be updated with changes to assumptions  in duration resource utilization sequencing or other information that is revealed as a result of developing the  schedule model  duration estimates   the number and availability of resources along with the  activity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates if the resourceleveling analysis changes  the resource requirements then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well  lessons learned register   the lessons learned register can be updated with  techniques that were efﬁcient and effective in developing the schedule model  resource requirements   resource leveling can have a signiﬁcant effect on  preliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required if the resourceleveling analysis changes  the resource requirements then the resource requirements are updated  risk register   the risk register may need to be updated to reﬂect opportunities or  threats perceived through scheduling assumptions      control schedule control schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managing  changes to the schedule baseline the key beneﬁt of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughout  the project this process is performed throughout the project   when an agile approach is used control schedule is concerned with  determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered and  accepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle  conducting retrospectives scheduled reviews to record lessons learned for correcting processes and improving  if required  reprioritizing the remaining work plan backlog  determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced validated and accepted velocity in the given time  per iteration agreedupon work cycle duration typically  weeks or  month  determining that the project schedule has changed and  managing the actual changes as they occur when work is being contracted regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means of  ensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control scheduled status reviews and  walkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.   the project charter provides the preapproved ﬁnancial resources from which the detailed  project costs are developed the project charter also deﬁnes the project approval requirements that will inﬂuence the  management of the project costs.   project management plan components include but are not limited to

acquire project resources such as making purchasing  renting or leasing. project teams may hold planning meetings to develop the cost management plan attendees may include the project  manager the project sponsor selected project team members selected stakeholders anyone with responsibility for  project costs and others as needed. the cost management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the project costs will  be planned structured and controlled the cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques are  documented in the cost management plan for example the cost management plan can establish the following  units of measure each unit used in measurements such as staff hours staff days or weeks for time measures  meters liters tons kilometers or cubic yards for quantity measures or lump sum in currency form is deﬁned  for each of the resources  level of precision this is the degree to which cost estimates will be

and may include an amount for contingencies    organizational procedures links the work breakdown structure wbs section  provides the  framework for the cost management plan allowing for consistency with the estimates budgets and control  of costs the wbs component used for the project cost accounting is called the control account each  control account is assigned a unique code or account numbers that links directly to the performing  organization’s accounting system  control thresholds variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be speciﬁed to indicate an  agreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken thresholds are typically  expressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan  rules of performance measurement earned value

process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete project  work the key beneﬁt of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project this process  is performed periodically throughout the project as needed  a cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the act.   project

and human resource costs and provide standard costs for material and equipment  published seller price lists are another source of information  exchange rates and inflation for largescale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies the  ﬂuctuations of currencies and inﬂation need to be understood and built into the estimate cost process. the organizational process assets that can inﬂuence the estimate costs process include but are not limited to  cost estimating policies  cost estimating templates  historical information and lessons learned repository.   expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics  previous similar projects  information in the industry discipline and application area and  cost estimating methods.   analogous cost estimating uses values or attributes of a previous project that are  similar to the current project values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to scope cost budget  duration and measures of scale eg size weight comparison of these project values or attributes becomes the basis  for estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project.   parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical data  and other variables eg square footage in construction to calculate a cost estimate for project work this technique can  produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model parametric  cost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project in conjunction with other estimating methods.   bottomup estimating is a method of estimating a component of work the cost  of individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail the detailed cost  is then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes the cost and  accuracy of bottomup cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individual  activity or work package.   the accuracy of singlepoint cost estimates may be improved by considering estimation  uncertainty and risk and using three estimates to deﬁne an approximate range for an activity’s cost  most likely cm the cost of the activity based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and any  predicted expenses  optimistic co the cost based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity  pessimistic cp the cost based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity   depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates the expected cost ce can  be calculated using a formula two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions the formulas are  triangular distribution ce  co  cm  cp    beta distribution ce  co  cm  cp   cost estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected cost and clarify the range of  uncertainty around the expected cost. data analysis techniques that can be used in the estimate costs process include but are not limited to  alternatives analysis alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identiﬁed options in order to select  which options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work of the project an example would be  evaluating the cost schedule resource and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable  reserve analysis cost estimates may include contingency reserves sometimes called contingency allowances  to account for cost uncertainty contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for  identiﬁed risks contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the known unknowns that can affect a project for example rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated while  the amount of this rework is unknown contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknown  amount of rework contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the speciﬁc activity to the entire  project the contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost a ﬁxed number or may be developed  by using quantitative analysis methods as more precise information about the project becomes available the contingency reserve may be used reduced  or eliminated contingency should be clearly identiﬁed in cost documentation contingency reserves are part of  the cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project  cost of quality assumptions about costs of quality section  may be used to prepare the estimates this  includes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance  it can also include looking at shortterm cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems later  on in the product life cycle.   the project management information system can include spreadsheets simulation  software and statistical analysis tools to assist with cost estimating such tools simplify the use of some costestimating  techniques and thereby facilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives. the decisionmaking techniques that can be used in the estimate costs process include but are not limited to voting    voting is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in  the form of future actions these techniques are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy and  commitment to the emerging estimates. cost estimates include quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project work as well as  contingency amounts to account for identiﬁed risks and management reserve to cover unplanned work cost estimates  can be presented in summary form or in detail costs are estimated for all resources that are applied to the cost  estimate this includes but is not limited to direct labor materials equipment services facilities information technology  and special categories such as cost of ﬁnancing including interest charges an inﬂation allowance exchange rates  or a cost contingency reserve indirect costs if they are included in the project estimate can be included at the activity  level or at higher levels. the amount and type of additional details supporting the cost estimate vary by application area regardless of  the level of detail the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the cost  estimate was derived supporting detail for cost estimates may include  documentation of the basis of the estimate ie how it was developed  documentation of all assumptions made  documentation of any known constraints  documentation of identiﬁed risks included when estimating costs  indication of the range of possible estimates eg us ± to indicate that the item is expected to  cost between a range of values and  indication of the conﬁdence level of the ﬁnal estimate. project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to  assumption log   during the cost estimates process new assumptions may be  made new constraints may be identiﬁed and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed  the assumption log should be updated with this new information  lessons learned register   the lessons learned register can be updated with  techniques that were efﬁcient and effective in developing cost estimates  risk register   the risk register may be updated when appropriate risk responses  are chosen and agreed upon during the estimate cost process      determine budget determine budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to  establish an authorized cost baseline the key beneﬁt of this process is that it determines the cost baseline

information in the industry discipline and application area  financial principles and  funding requirement and sources. cost estimates are aggregated by work packages in accordance with the wbs the work package cost estimates  are then aggregated for the higher component levels of the wbs such as control accounts and ultimately for the  entire project. a data analysis technique that can be used in the determine budget process includes but is not limited to reserve  analysis which can establish the management reserves for the project management reserves are an amount of  the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are reserved for unforeseen work that is within  scope of the project management reserves are intended to address the unknown unknowns that can affect a project  the management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but is part of the overall project budget and funding  requirements when an amount of management reserves is used to fund unforeseen work the amount of management  reserve used is added to the cost baseline thus requiring an approved change to the cost baseline. reviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates historical  information may include project characteristics parameters to develop mathematical models to predict total project  costs such models may be simple eg residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space  or complex eg one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors each of which  has numerous points within it both the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely they are most likely to be  reliable when  historical information used to develop the model is accurate  parameters used in the model are readily quantiﬁable and  models are scalable such that they work for large projects small projects and phases of a project. the expenditure of funds should be reconciled with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project  a variance between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling of  work to level out the rate of expenditures this is accomplished by placing imposed date constraints for work into  the project schedule. financing entails acquiring funding for projects it is common for longterm infrastructure industrial and public  services projects to seek external sources of funds if a project is funded externally the funding entity may have certain  requirements that are required to be met. the cost baseline is the approved version of the timephased project budget excluding any management reserves  which can only be changed through formal change control procedures it is used as a basis for comparison to actual  results the cost baseline is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities figure  illustrates the various components of the project budget and cost baseline cost estimates for the various  project activities along with any contingency reserves see section  for these activities are aggregated  into their associated work package costs the work package cost estimates along with any contingency reserves  estimated for the work packages are aggregated into control accounts the summation of the control accounts  make up the cost baseline since the cost estimates that make up the cost baseline are directly tied to the schedule  activities this enables a timephased view of the cost baseline which is typically displayed in the form of an scurve  as is illustrated in figure  for projects that use earned value management the cost baseline is referred to as the  performance measurement baseline management reserves section  are added to the cost baseline to produce the project budget as changes  warranting the use of management reserves arise the change control process is used to obtain approval to move the  applicable management reserve funds into the cost baseline   figure  project budget components  figure  cost baseline expenditures and funding requirements activity cost

estimated costs for each activity may be recorded as part of the  project schedule  risk register   new risks identiﬁed during this process are recorded in the risk  register and managed using the risk management processes    control costs control costs is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs and managing changes  to the cost baseline the key beneﬁt of this process is that the cost baseline is maintained throughout the project this  process is performed throughout the project   updating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date any increase to the authorized budget can  only be approved through the perform integrated change control process section  monitoring the expenditure of  funds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project other  than to track the outﬂow of funds much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the  consumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures the key to effective cost control  is the management of the approved cost baseline project cost control includes  inﬂuencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline  ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner  managing the actual changes when and as they occur  ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period by wbs component by activity  and in total for the project  monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline  monitoring work performance against funds expended  preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage  informing

baseline to the  actual schedule and cost performance evm integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule  baseline to form the performance measurement baseline evm develops and monitors three key dimensions for  each work package and control account  planned value planned value pv is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work it is the authorized  budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure wbs component  not including management reserve this budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project but at a given  point in time planned value deﬁnes the physical work that should have been accomplished the total of the  pv is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline pmb the total planned value for the  project is also known as budget at completion bac  earned value earned value ev is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized  for that work it is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed the ev being  measured needs to be related to the pmb and the ev measured cannot be greater than the authorized  pv budget for a component the ev is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project progress  measurement criteria should be established for each wbs component to measure work in progress project  managers monitor ev both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long term performance trends  actual cost actual cost ac is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a  speciﬁc time period it is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the ev measured the ac  needs to correspond in deﬁnition to what was budgeted in the

cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements  for projects not using formal earned value analysis similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing  planned cost

schedule  baseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed cost performance measurements are used to assess  the magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline an important aspect of project cost control includes  determining the cause and degree of v. the tocomplete performance index tcpi is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with  the remaining resources in order to meet a speciﬁed management goal expressed as the ratio of the cost to ﬁnish  the outstanding work to the remaining budget tcpi is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on the  remaining work to meet a speciﬁed management goal such as the bac or the eac if it becomes obvious that the bac  is no longer viable the project manager should consider the forecasted

falls below the baseline as shown in figure  all future work of the project will need  to be performed immediately in the range of the tcpi bac as reﬂected in the top line of figure  to stay  within the authorized bac whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgment call based on a number of  considerations including risk time remaining in the project and technical performance this level of performance  is displayed as the tcpi eac line the equation for the tcpi is based on the eac bac ev  eac ac the evm  formulas are provided in table    earned value analysis lexicon defnition how used equation abbreviation name interpretation of result the authorized budget assigned to  scheduled work the measure of work performed  expressed in terms of the budget  authorized for that work the realized cost incurred for the  work performed on an activity during  a specific time period the sum of all budgets established  for the work to be performed the amount of budget deficit or  surplus at a given point in time  expressed as the difference between  the earned value and the actual cost the amount by which the project is  ahead or behind the planned  delivery date at a given point in  time expressed as the difference  between the earned value and the  planned value a projection of the amount of budget  deficit or surplus expressed as the  difference between the budget at  completion and the estimate at  completion a measure of the cost efficiency of  budgeted resources  expressed as the ratio of earned  value to actual cost a measure of schedule efficiency  expressed as the ratio of earned  value to planned value the expected total cost of com pleting all work expressed as the  sum of the actual cost to date and  the estimate to complete the expected cost to finish all the  remaining project work a measure of the cost performance  that must be achieved with the  remaining resources in order to meet  a specified management goal  expressed as the ratio of the cost to  finish the outstanding work to the  budget available planned  value earned.   project management information systems are often used to monitor the three evm  dimensions pv ev and ac to display graphical trends and to forecast a range of possible ﬁnal project results.   work performance information includes information on how the project work is  performing compared to the cost baseline variances in the work performed and the cost of the work are evaluated at  the work package level and control account level for projects using earned value analysis cv cpi eac vac and tcpi  are documented for inclusion in work performance reports section. either a calculated eac value or a bottomup eac value is documented and communicated to stakeholders.   analysis of project performance may result in a change request to the cost and  schedule baselines or other components of the project management plan change requests are processed for review  and disposition through the perform integrated change control process section. any change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change  request components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to  cost management plan   changes to the cost management plan such as changes  to control thresholds or speciﬁed levels of accuracy required in managing the project’s cost are incorporated in  response to feedback from relevant stakeholders  cost baseline   changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to  approved changes in scope resources or cost estimates in some cases cost variances can be so severe that a  revised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement  performance measurement baseline   changes to the performance measurement  baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope schedule performance or cost estimates  in some cases the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the  performance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement. project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to  assumption log   cost performance may indicate the need to revise assumptions  on resource productivity and other factors inﬂuencing cost performance  basis of estimates   cost performance may indicate the need to revisit the original  basis of estimates  cost estimates   cost estimates may need to be updated to reﬂect the actual cost  efﬁciency for the project  lessons learned register   the lessons learned register can be updated with  techniques that were effective in maintaining the budget variance analysis earned value analysis forecasting  and corrective actions that were used to respond to cost variances  risk register   the risk register may be updated if the cost variances have crossed  or are likely to cross the cost threshold.  project charter.  project management plan.  enterprise environmental factors.  organizational process assets.  expert judgment.  data analysis.

Figure 7-10. plan scope management is the process of creating a scope management plan that documents how the project and  product scope will be deﬁned validated and controlled the key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides guidance and  direction on how scope will be managed throughout the project this process is performed once or at predeﬁned points  in the project  the scope management plan is a component of the project or program management plan that describes how the  scope will be deﬁned developed monitored controlled and validated the development of the scope management plan  and the detailing of the project scope begin with the analysis of information contained in the project charter section   the latest approved subsidiary plans of the project management plan section  historical information  contained in the organizational process assets section  and any other relevant enterprise environmental factors  section. collect requirements is the process of determining documenting and managing stakeholder needs and requirements  to meet objectives the key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides the basis for deﬁning the product scope and project  scope this process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project   the pmbokguide does not speciﬁcally address product requirements since those are industry speciﬁc note that  business analysis for practitioners a practice guide  provides more indepth information about product requirements  the project’s success is directly inﬂuenced by active stakeholder involvement in the discovery and decomposition of  needs into project and product requirements and by the care taken in determining documenting and managing the  requirements of the product service or result of the project requirements include conditions or capabilities that are  required to be present in a product service or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed speciﬁcation  requirements include the quantiﬁed and documented needs and expectations of the sponsor customer and other  stakeholders these requirements need to be elicited analyzed and recorded in enough detail to be included in the  scope baseline and to be measured once project execution begins requirements become the foundation of the wbs  cost schedule quality planning and procurement are all based on these requirements. define scope is the process of developing a detailed description of the project and product the key benefit of  this process is that it describes the product service or result boundaries and acceptance criteria. create wbs is the process of subdividing project deliverables and project work into smaller more manageable  components the key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides a framework of what has to be delivered this process is  performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project  the wbs is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish  the project objectives and create the required deliverables the wbs organizes and deﬁnes the total scope of the project  and represents the work speciﬁed in the current approved project scope statement the planned work is contained within the lowest level of wbs components which are called work packages a work  package can be used to group the activities where work is scheduled and estimated monitored and controlled in the  context of the wbs work refers to work products or deliverables that are the result of activity and not to the activity itself. validate scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables the key beneﬁt of this  process is that it brings objectivity to the acceptance process and increases the probability of ﬁnal product service  or result acceptance by validating each deliverable this process is performed periodically throughout the project as  needed. control scope is the process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes to  the scope baseline the key beneﬁt of this process is that the scope baseline is maintained throughout the project this  process is performed throughout the project. plan schedule management is the process of establishing the policies procedures and documentation for  planning developing managing executing and controlling the project schedule the key beneﬁt of this process is  that it provides guidance and direction on how the project schedule will be managed throughout the project this  process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project. deﬁne activities is the process of identifying and documenting the speciﬁc actions to be performed to produce  the project deliverables the key beneﬁt of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activities  that provide a basis for estimating scheduling executing monitoring and controlling the project work this process  is performed throughout the project. sequence activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities the key  beneﬁt of this process is that it deﬁnes the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efﬁciency given all project  constraints this process is performed throughout the project   every activity except the ﬁrst and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successor  activity with an appropriate logical relationship logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic project  schedule it may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable project  schedule sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automated  techniques the sequence activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram to  act as a ﬁrst step to publish the schedule baseline. estimate activity durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual  activities with estimated resources the key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity  will take to complete this process is performed throughout the project   number of resources as well as the schedule network analysis technique used  the estimate activity durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete  the activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity these estimates are used to  approximate the number of work periods activity duration needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project  and resource calendars in many cases the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an  activity along with the skill proﬁciency of those resources may determine the activity’s duration a change to a driving  resource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration but this is not a simple “straightline” or  linear relationship sometimes the intrinsic nature of the work ie constraints imposed on the duration effort involved  or number of resources will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation  eg a hour stress test other factors for consideration when estimating duration include  law of diminishing returns when one factor eg resource used to determine the effort required to produce a  unit of work is increased while all other factors remain ﬁxed a point will eventually be reached at which additions  of that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output  number of resources increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does  not always reduce the time by half as it may increase extra duration due to risk and at some point adding  too many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer learning curve additional  coordination and other factors involved  advances in technology this may also play an important role in determining duration estimates for example an  increase in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology  which may impact duration and resource needs  motivation of staff the project manager also needs to be aware of student syndrome or procrastination  when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline and parkinson’s law  where work expands to ﬁll the time available for its completion all data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate. develop schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences durations resource requirements and schedule  constraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling the key beneﬁt of this  process is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities this process  is performed throughout the project   figure  develop schedule data flow diagram developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process the schedule model is used to determine the  planned start and ﬁnish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information schedule  development can require the review and revision of duration estimates resource estimates and schedule reserves to  establish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress key steps include deﬁning the  project milestones identifying and sequencing activities and estimating durations once the activity start and ﬁnish  dates have been determined it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned  activities the staff conﬁrms that the start and ﬁnish dates present no conﬂict with resource calendars or assigned  activities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid the schedule is then analyzed to determine conﬂicts with  logical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined revising and  maintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project  as   for more speciﬁc information regarding scheduling refer to the practice standard for scheduling. control schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managing  changes to the schedule baseline the key beneﬁt of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughout  the project this process is performed throughout the project   when an agile approach is used control schedule is concerned with  determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered and  accepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle  conducting retrospectives scheduled reviews to record lessons learned for correcting processes and improving  if required  reprioritizing the remaining work plan backlog  determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced validated and accepted velocity in the given time  per iteration agreedupon work cycle duration typically  weeks or  month  determining that the project schedule has changed and  managing the actual changes as they occur when work is being contracted regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means of  ensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control scheduled status reviews and  walkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete. plan cost management is the process of deﬁning how the project costs will be estimated budgeted managed  monitored and controlled the key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the project  costs will be managed throughout the project this process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project the    the cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the cost  management processes so that performance of the processes will be efﬁcient and coordinated the cost management  processes and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan the cost management  plan is a component of the project management plan. estimate costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete project  work the key beneﬁt of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project this process  is performed periodically throughout the project as needed  a cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the activity it is a  prediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time cost estimates include the identiﬁcation and  consideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project cost tradeoffs and risks should be considered  such as make versus buy buy versus lease and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project cost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency ie dollars euros yen etc although in some  instances other units of measure such as staff hours or staff days are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating the  effects of currency ﬂuctuations cost estimates should be reviewed and reﬁned during the course of the project to reﬂect additional detail as it becomes  available and assumptions are tested the accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses through  the project life cycle for example a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude rom estimate  in the range of  to  later in the project as more information is known deﬁnitive estimates could narrow  the range of accuracy to  to  in some organizations there are guidelines for when such reﬁnements can be  made and the degree of conﬁdence or accuracy that is expected costs are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project this includes but is not limited to labor  materials equipment services and facilities as well as special categories such as an inﬂation allowance cost of  ﬁnancing or contingency costs cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form. determine budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to  establish an authorized cost baseline the key beneﬁt of this process is that it determines the cost baseline against  which project performance can be monitored and controlled this process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in  the project  figure  determine budget data flow diagram. control costs is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs and managing changes  to the cost baseline the key beneﬁt of this process is that the cost baseline is maintained throughout the project this  process is performed throughout the project   updating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date any increase to the authorized budget can  only be approved through the perform integrated change control process section  monitoring the expenditure of  funds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project other  than to track the outﬂow of funds much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the  consumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures the key to effective cost control  is the management of the approved cost baseline project cost control includes  inﬂuencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline  ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner  managing the actual changes when and as they occur  ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period by wbs component by activity  and in total for the project  monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline  monitoring work performance against funds expended  preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage  informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost and  bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits'"
