43, decomposition,Has_Technics_Tools,decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project deliverables into  smaller more manageable parts the work package is the work deﬁned at the lowest level of the wbs for which cost and  duration can be estimated and managed the level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed to  effectively manage the project the level of detail for work packages will vary with the size and complexity of the project  decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally involves the following activities  identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work  structuring and organizing the wbs  decomposing the upper wbs levels into lowerlevel detailed components  developing and assigning identiﬁcation codes to the wbs components and  verifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate a portion of a wbs with some branches of the wbs decomposed down through the work package level is shown in  figure  figure  sample wbs decomposed down through work packages  value management system project  needs assessment  standards development  systems engineering   project management the wbs is illustrative only it is not intended to represent the full project scope of any specific project  nor to imply that this is the only way to organize a wbs on this type of project  components identification  gap assessment  alternatives identification  system requirements development  alternatives development  requirements determination  current system audit  components analysis  requirements changes identification  alternatives analysis   a wbs structure may be created through various approaches some of the popular methods include the topdown  approach the use of organizationspeciﬁc guidelines and the use of wbs templates a bottomup approach can be used  to group subcomponents the wbs structure can be represented in a number of forms such as  using phases of the project life cycle as the second level of decomposition with the product and project  deliverables inserted at the third level as shown in figure   using major deliverables as the second level of decomposition as shown in figure  and  incorporating subcomponents that may be developed by organizations outside the project team such as  contracted work the seller then develops the supporting contract wbs as part of the contracted work figure  sample wbs organized by phase planning software product  release  detail  design construct integration  and test project  management

and  evaluation the wbs is illustrative only it is not intended to represent the full project scope of any specific project  nor to imply that this is the only way to organize a wbs on this type of project figure  sample wbs with major deliverables decomposition of the upperlevel wbs components requires subdividing the work for each of the deliverables or  subcomponents into its most fundamental components where the wbs components represent veriﬁable products services  or results if an agile approach is used epics can be decomposed into user stories the wbs may be structured as an  outline an organizational chart or other method that identiﬁes a hierarchical breakdown verifying the correctness of the  decomposition requires determining that the lowerlevel wbs components are those that are necessary and sufﬁcient for  completion of the corresponding higherlevel deliverables different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition  to arrive at a work package the work for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level while others need  additional levels of decomposition as the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail the ability to plan manage and  control the work is enhanced however excessive decomposition can lead to nonproductive management effort inefﬁcient  use of resources decreased efﬁciency in performing the work and difﬁculty aggregating data over different levels of the wbs decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the future  the project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on so the details of the  wbs can be developed this technique is sometimes referred to as rolling wave planning   the wbs represents all product and project work including the project management work the total of the work at  the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed this is  sometimes called the  percent rule for speciﬁc information regarding the wbs refer to the practice standard for work breakdown structures second  edition  this standard contains industryspeciﬁc examples of wbs templates that can be tailored to speciﬁc projects  in a particular application area, create wbs,,vector_decomposition

80, dependency determination and integration,Has_Technics_Tools,dependencies may be characterized by the following attributes mandatory or discretionary internal or external  as described below dependency has four attributes but two can be applicable at the same time in the following  ways mandatory external dependencies mandatory internal dependencies discretionary external dependencies or  discretionary internal dependencies  mandatory dependencies mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or  inherent in the nature of the work mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations such as on a  construction project where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built  or on an electronics project where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested mandatory dependencies  are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies technical dependencies may not be mandatory  the project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities  mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool  discretionary dependencies discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic  preferential logic or soft logic discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best  practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a speciﬁc sequence  is desired even though there may be other acceptable sequences for example generally accepted best  practices recommend that during construction the electrical work should start after ﬁnishing the plumbing  work this order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time in parallel but performing  the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk discretionary dependencies should be fully  documented since they can create arbitrary total ﬂoat values and can limit later scheduling options when fast  tracking techniques are employed these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for  modiﬁcation or removal the project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the process  of sequencing the activities      external dependencies external dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non project activities these dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control for example the  testing activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source or  governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction  project the project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of  sequencing the activities  internal dependencies internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and  are generally inside the project team’s control for example if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble  it there is an internal mandatory dependency the project management team determines which dependencies  are internal during the process of sequencing the activities, sequence activities,,dependence finding integrating 
81, leads and lags,Has_Technics_Tools,a lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity for example  on a project to construct a new ofﬁce building the landscaping could be scheduled to start  weeks prior to the scheduled  punch list completion this would be shown as a ﬁnishtostart with a week lead as shown in figure  lead is often  represented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software figure  examples of lead and lag complete punch list write draft landscape building lot edit draft ss  days lag fs  weeks lead   a lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity for example  a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document  days after they begin writing it this can be  shown as a starttostart relationship with a day lag as shown in figure  lag can also be represented in project  schedule network diagrams as shown in figure  in the relationship between activities h and i as indicated by the  nomenclature ss starttostart plus  days lag even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale the project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately deﬁne the  logical relationship the use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic also duration estimates do not include  any leads or lags activities and their related assumptions should be documented figure  project schedule network diagram, sequence activities,,lead slowdown

performance measurement baseline to the  actual schedule and cost performance evm integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule  baseline to form the performance measurement baseline evm develops and monitors three key dimensions for  each work package and control account  planned value planned value pv is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work it is the authorized  budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure wbs component  not including management reserve this budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project but at a given  point in time planned value deﬁnes the physical work that should have been accomplished the total of the  pv is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline pmb the total planned value for the  project is also known as budget at completion bac  earned value earned value ev is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized  for that work it is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed the ev being  measured needs to be related to the pmb and the ev measured cannot be greater than the authorized  pv budget for a component the ev is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project progress  measurement criteria should be established for each wbs component to measure work in progress project  managers monitor ev both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long term performance trends  actual cost actual cost ac is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a  speciﬁc time period it is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the ev measured the ac  needs to correspond in deﬁnition to what was budgeted in the pv and measured in the ev eg direct hours  only direct costs only or all costs including indirect costs the ac will have no upper limit whatever is spent  to achieve the ev

 bac eac variances cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements  for projects not using formal earned value analysis similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing  planned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance  further analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedule  baseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed cost performance measurements are used to assess  the magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline an important aspect of project cost control includes  determining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline see section  and deciding  whether corrective or preventive action is required the percentage range of acceptable variances will tend to  decrease as more work is accomplished examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to  schedule variance schedule variance sv is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference  between the earned value and the planned value it is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind  the planned delivery date at a given point in time it is a measure of schedule performance on a project it  is equal to the earned value ev minus the planned value pv the eva schedule variance is a useful metric  in that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule the eva schedule  variance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will have  been earned schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method cpm scheduling and  risk management equation sv  ev pv  cost variance cost variance cv is the amount of budget deﬁcit or surplus at a given point in time expressed  as the difference between earned value and the actual cost it is a measure of cost performance on a project  it is equal to the earned value ev minus the actual cost ac the cost variance at the end of the project will  be the difference between the budget at completion bac and the actual amount spent the cv is particularly  critical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent negative cv is often  difﬁcult for the project to recover equation cv  ev ac    schedule performance index the schedule performance index spi is a measure of schedule efﬁciency  expressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value it measures how efﬁciently the project team is  accomplishing the work it is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index cpi to forecast  the ﬁnal project completion estimates an spi value less than  indicates less work was completed than  was planned an spi greater than  indicates that more work was completed than was planned since the  spi measures all project work the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine  whether the project will ﬁnish ahead of or behind its planned ﬁnish date the spi is equal to the ratio of the  ev to the pv equation spi  evpv  cost performance index the cost performance index cpi is a measure of the cost efﬁciency of budgeted  resources expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost it is considered the most critical eva metric  and measures the cost efﬁciency for the work completed a cpi value of less than  indicates a cost overrun  for work completed a cpi value greater than  indicates a cost underrun of performance to date the cpi is  equal to the ratio of the ev to

for understanding  performance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of bac versus estimate at  completion eac and completion dates examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to  charts in earned value analysis three parameters of planned value earned value and actual cost can be  monitored and reported on both a periodbyperiod basis

project performance if it becomes  obvious that the bac is no longer viable the project manager should consider the forecasted eac forecasting  the eac involves making projections of conditions and events in the project’s future based on current  performance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast forecasts are generated  updated and reissued based on work

encounter to perform the etc  based on its experience to date earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of the  required eac costs the most common eac forecasting approach is a manual bottomup summation by the  project manager and project team the project manager’s bottomup eac method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred for   the work completed and

analysis   during cost control reserve analysis is used to monitor the  status of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed or  if additional reserves need to be requested as work on the project progresses these reserves may be used as  planned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies conversely when opportunities are captured  and resulting in cost savings funds may be added to the contingency amount or taken from the project as  marginproﬁt if the identiﬁed risks do not occur the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget to  free up resources for other projects or operations additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a need  to request that additional reserves be added to
