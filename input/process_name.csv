 define activities,deﬁne activities is the process of identifying and documenting the speciﬁc actions to be performed to produce  the project deliverables the key beneﬁt of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activities  that provide a basis for estimating scheduling executing monitoring and controlling the project work this process  is performed throughout the project,delimit activity 
 sequence activities,sequence activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities the key  beneﬁt of this process is that it deﬁnes the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efﬁciency given all project  constraints this process is performed throughout the project   every activity except the ﬁrst and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successor  activity with an appropriate logical relationship logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic project  schedule it may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable project  schedule sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automated  techniques the sequence activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram to  act as a ﬁrst step to publish the schedule baseline,episode activity 
 estimate activity durations,estimate activity durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual  activities with estimated resources the key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity  will take to complete this process is performed throughout the project   number of resources as well as the schedule network analysis technique used  the estimate activity durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete  the activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity these estimates are used to  approximate the number of work periods activity duration needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project  and resource calendars in many cases the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an  activity along with the skill proﬁciency of those resources may determine the activity’s duration a change to a driving  resource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration but this is not a simple “straightline” or  linear relationship sometimes the intrinsic nature of the work ie constraints imposed on the duration effort involved  or number of resources will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation  eg a hour stress test other factors for consideration when estimating duration include  law of diminishing returns when one factor eg resource used to determine the effort required to produce a  unit of work is increased while all other factors remain ﬁxed a point will eventually be reached at which additions  of that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output  number of resources increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does  not always reduce the time by half as it may increase extra duration due to risk and at some point adding  too many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer learning curve additional  coordination and other factors involved  advances in technology this may also play an important role in determining duration estimates for example an  increase in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology  which may impact duration and resource needs  motivation of staff the project manager also needs to be aware of student syndrome or procrastination  when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline and parkinson’s law  where work expands to ﬁll the time available for its completion all data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate,approximation action duration 
 develop schedule,develop schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences durations resource requirements and schedule  constraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling the key beneﬁt of this  process is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities this process  is performed throughout the project   figure  develop schedule data flow diagram developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process the schedule model is used to determine the  planned start and ﬁnish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information schedule  development can require the review and revision of duration estimates resource estimates and schedule reserves to  establish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress key steps include deﬁning the  project milestones identifying and sequencing activities and estimating durations once the activity start and ﬁnish  dates have been determined it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned  activities the staff conﬁrms that the start and ﬁnish dates present no conﬂict with resource calendars or assigned  activities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid the schedule is then analyzed to determine conﬂicts with  logical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined revising and  maintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project  as   for more speciﬁc information regarding scheduling refer to the practice standard for scheduling,acquire agenda 
 control schedule,control schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managing  changes to the schedule baseline the key beneﬁt of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughout  the project this process is performed throughout the project   when an agile approach is used control schedule is concerned with  determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered and  accepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle  conducting retrospectives scheduled reviews to record lessons learned for correcting processes and improving  if required  reprioritizing the remaining work plan backlog  determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced validated and accepted velocity in the given time  per iteration agreedupon work cycle duration typically  weeks or  month  determining that the project schedule has changed and  managing the actual changes as they occur when work is being contracted regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means of  ensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control scheduled status reviews and  walkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete,dominance agenda 
 plan cost management,plan cost management is the process of deﬁning how the project costs will be estimated budgeted managed  monitored and controlled the key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the project  costs will be managed throughout the project this process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in the project the    the cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the cost  management processes so that performance of the processes will be efﬁcient and coordinated the cost management  processes and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan the cost management  plan is a component of the project management plan,program toll direction 
 estimate costs,estimate costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete project  work the key beneﬁt of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project this process  is performed periodically throughout the project as needed  a cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the activity it is a  prediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time cost estimates include the identiﬁcation and  consideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project cost tradeoffs and risks should be considered  such as make versus buy buy versus lease and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project cost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency ie dollars euros yen etc although in some  instances other units of measure such as staff hours or staff days are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating the  effects of currency ﬂuctuations cost estimates should be reviewed and reﬁned during the course of the project to reﬂect additional detail as it becomes  available and assumptions are tested the accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses through  the project life cycle for example a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude rom estimate  in the range of  to  later in the project as more information is known deﬁnitive estimates could narrow  the range of accuracy to  to  in some organizations there are guidelines for when such reﬁnements can be  made and the degree of conﬁdence or accuracy that is expected costs are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project this includes but is not limited to labor  materials equipment services and facilities as well as special categories such as an inﬂation allowance cost of  ﬁnancing or contingency costs cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form,approximation cost 
 determine budget,determine budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to  establish an authorized cost baseline the key beneﬁt of this process is that it determines the cost baseline against  which project performance can be monitored and controlled this process is performed once or at predeﬁned points in  the project  figure  determine budget data flow diagram,find_out budget 
 control costs,control costs is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs and managing changes  to the cost baseline the key beneﬁt of this process is that the cost baseline is maintained throughout the project this  process is performed throughout the project   updating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date any increase to the authorized budget can  only be approved through the perform integrated change control process section  monitoring the expenditure of  funds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project other  than to track the outﬂow of funds much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the  consumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures the key to effective cost control  is the management of the approved cost baseline project cost control includes  inﬂuencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline  ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner  managing the actual changes when and as they occur  ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period by wbs component by activity  and in total for the project  monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline  monitoring work performance against funds expended  preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage  informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost and  bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits,dominance cost
